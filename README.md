Message for Tudor:
If you want to add modifications to the current state of the repository push them on a separate branch and make a pull request with me as a reviewer. I will do the same when I want to add some changes.
Make sure that if you are called for reviewing others code to analyse it and not just aprove the pull request.
The merges onto the main branch will be my responsability, please restrain from merging anything.
